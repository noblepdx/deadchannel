I have a Youtube addiction. My default is spending hours a day, consuming Linux, LOSS (I have decided to start using "Libre" in place of "Free" in Free & Open Source Software just to piss off all the RMS/Free Software folks), gaming, and tech content. I spend more time watching stuff about the things I want to do, than I spend time actually doing the things I want to do. It's actually kind of pathetic, and the shame is really starting to get to me. However, I find myself getting sucked into culture war bullshit. And then I am up till 4am in a death spiral of consuming content that I find vile, blindly ideological, partisan, and proof of diminishing intellectual fortitude---*on both "sides."* 

I thought I might be able to "fix" this by switching to Odysee. My initial descent into Odysee was less than pleasant. Apparently, Odysee is where all the cancelled far-right leaning voices go to die. Findind progressive/anarchist content on the platform is like pulling teeth. But I decided to give it another try, as I loathe Google, and a lot of my favorite Linux content creators have their content posted there. I figured I could engage solely with the content of my choice, outside of the Google algorithim and long extensive trackers. And I was content on moving my content consuming addiction to the new platform.

But then I got a notification for some Odysee "Better Discourses Conference." Interested in the concept, I clicked the notification. They claim to have voices from "various sides of the political spectrum." When I looked at the list, I could only shake my head. Out of the 20 to 30 some presenters, I found **two** maybe two and half left-leaning or nuanced voices.
