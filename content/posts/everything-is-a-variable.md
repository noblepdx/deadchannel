So I have been editting a clinical ethnography, which is to be peer-reviewed, and I had a sudden realization. My author fully wrote out the name of an organization for which she had already called defined the acronym earlier in the text. And that is when it hit me. Called! Defined! The acronym is merely a variable. And then I was looking at everything in the retail shop that work in. Names of things are just abstracted variables of their physical counterparts. Prices are abstracted variables for assumed value. 

Everything is a variable.

As someone learning to code, who has struggled with such grand-scale abstraction, it all clicked. When we "define" a variable, all we're actually doing is giving a name to a process that we want a machine to process. While this much was evident to me, being able to recognize everyday objects and actions as variables, functions, calls, and input/output will help tremendously. If only I would have taken to the sciences earlier in life, instead of the arts, I may have recognized this. I have always decried the sciences for attempting to make everything "black and white," or binary if you will, but coding is merely a utilitarian practice in symbolism. It is all begining to make more sense. 

Anyway, back to editting.
