Holy shit, this has been a test of fortitude. Every video, every post, every how-to, has been from a different operating system, different text editor/IDE, different versions of software (my first build was borked from install. It only took me two days to figure that oen out). Anyway, here it finally fucking is. My stupid self-important blog about god knows what. All I know, is that I need a proverbial toilet to spew my garbage, or else it becomes infectious and I get radioactive. 

I hope to document my movement away from mainstream tech to Free/Libre Open Source Software (FOSS) and Linux. I hope to have some space to maybe puke out some of my armchair philosophic meanderings. Whatever appears from this terminal and perpetually blinking cursor, I can promise will be authentic, vulnerable, and hopefully at least a little bit humorous, if only at my own expense. Anyway, more to come. If you are reading this, thanks for tuning in. Feel free to hit me up, anytime.
