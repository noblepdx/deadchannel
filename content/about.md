![Noble as TV Head](/img/tvhead.jpeg)

I am Noble. At least that what a handful of people still call me, at least when we're in private. I had originally written a very pointed and telling bio for myself, in third person of course, that outlined my life, warts and all. But then I thought about it. If I really wanted to put myself out there, I would probably use my bith name. Not that I am trying to hide, but that I want a place where I can write honestly and authentically. 

So I'll just say that I am in my forties. I lived a long fucked up life, full of shit that would make Oprah Winfrey cry. I survived it all, and love sitting at home in front of a blinking cursor of my terminal emulator de jour. I am a Linux fanboy, and I am obsessed with free & open source software. Raised on punk rock and a heavy dose of illicit narcotics (sober now), I need a place I can spew my vitriol, without fear of getting kicked out of the cool kids club.

So this is my dead channel, as prophecied by the great William Gibson. This is the static, reaching through your monitor, as you have passed out drunk, yet again, exhausted by the meaninglessness and mediocrity of it all. Maybe in this technological hellscape of our own making, we can find one place, our own "Neon City" if you will. A place for the pirates, the malcontents, the technoanarchists, and the perpetual lost causes. A place where we can fight, scream, hack, and find any form of personal evolution that we allow ourselves. Because we will no longer be beholden to any one system, any one tech, any one ideology. 

Only a means to an end. 

Maybe one voice. 

Maybe one chance. 

It has to be out there. 

Doesn't it?
