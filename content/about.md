>>William Gibson  *Neuromancer*

Noble is renaissance man of sorts---a connoisseur of suffering. Starting in the projects and then moving to the trailer park once the gang wars popped off, Noble was intimately aquainted with poverty and alienation by a very young age. As he entered his formative years, Noble went on to experience incarceration, the murder of his father, being orphaned, homelessness, drug addiction, gang violence, sex work, the list goes on. But from the rubble of his youth, Noble emerged victorious. Sober, college educated, published writer, social worker, meditation teacher. But finding it all empty and arbitrary, Noble has consistantly, throughout his life, turned to the two things that have been any sort of anchor for him---writing and tech. 

So this is his dead channel, as prophecied by the great William Gibson. This is the static, reaching through your monitor, as you have passed out drunk, yet again, exhausted by the meaninglessness and mediocrity of it all. Maybe in this technological hellscape of our own making, we can find one place, our own "Neon City" if you will. A place for the pirates, the malcontents, the technoanarchists, and the perpetual lost causes. A place where we can fight, scream, hack, and find any form of personal evolution that we allow ourselves. Because we will no longer be beholden to any one system, any one tech, any one ideology. Only a means to an end. Maybe one voice. Maybe one chance. It has to be out there. Doesn't it?
