      <description>I had to go to the ear doctor today. I have fucked up ears, so I am a regular at my ENT clinic. The clinic is way off the beaten path, and I always have to walk through the parking lot of the Clackamas Town Center, between the lightrail and the clinic. It has become a normal thing for me to go to Barnes &amp;amp; Noble their to pick up the latest copy of the Atlantic and read it over shitty mall food.</description>

      <description>I have a Youtube addiction. My default is spending hours a day, consuming Linux, LOSS (I have decided to start using &amp;ldquo;Libre&amp;rdquo; in place of &amp;ldquo;Free&amp;rdquo; in Free &amp;amp; Open Source Software just to piss off all the RMS/Free Software folks), gaming, and tech content. I spend more time watching stuff about the things I want to do, than I spend time actually doing the things I want to do. It&amp;rsquo;s actually kind of pathetic, and the shame is really starting to get to me.</description>

      <description>Holy shit, this has been a test of fortitude. Every video, every post, every how-to, has been from a different operating system, different text editor/IDE, different versions of software (my first build was borked from install. It only took me two days to figure that oen out). Anyway, here it finally fucking is. My stupid self-important blog about god knows what. All I know, is that I need a proverbial toilet to spew my garbage, or else it becomes infectious and I get radioactive.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;The sky was the color of a television, tuned to a dead channel&amp;rdquo;
 William Gibson Neuromancer
  Noble is renaissance man of sorts&amp;mdash;a connoisseur of suffering. Starting in the projects and then moving to the trailer park once the gang wars popped off, Noble was intimately aquainted with poverty and alienation by a very young age. As he entered his formative years, Noble went on to experience incarceration, the murder of his father, being orphaned, homelessness, drug addiction, gang violence, sex work, the list goes on.</description>
