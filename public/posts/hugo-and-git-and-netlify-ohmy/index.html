<p>I hope to document my movement away from mainstream tech to Free/Libre Open Source Software (FOSS) and Linux. I hope to have some space to maybe puke out some of my armchair philosophic meanderings. Whatever appears from this terminal and perpetually blinking cursor, I can promise will be authentic, vulnerable, and hopefully at least a little bit humorous, if only at my own expense. Anyway, more to come. If you are reading this, thanks for tuning in. Feel free to hit me up, anytime.</p>
