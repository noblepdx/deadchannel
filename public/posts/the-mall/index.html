			<p>I had to go to the ear doctor today. I have fucked up ears, so I am a regular at my ENT clinic. The clinic is way off the beaten path, and I always have to walk through the parking lot of the Clackamas Town Center, between the lightrail and the clinic. It has become a normal thing for me to go to Barnes &amp; Noble their to pick up the latest copy of the Atlantic and read it over shitty mall food. Today, my appointment was earlier than usual, so I figured I would walk a lap of the mall and see what the &ldquo;mall world&rdquo; is like.</p>
<p>Now, as of the last few years, I have become mildly obsessed with the concept of the mall. Whether it is the Mallsoft subgenre of vaporwave or watching abandoned mall videos, the mall has been a regular thought of mine for a while. Mallsoft is a genre of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxayjNCSBzs">vaporwave</a> and/or <a href="http://www.plunderphonics.com/xhtml/xplunder.html">plunderphonics</a> where Muzak, soft jazz, or easy listening tracks are smapled, compressed, distroted and layered with ambiant crowd/mall sounds to create an ephemeral and somehow nostalgic &ldquo;mall-like experience.&rdquo; As someone who grew up in the 80s, during the advent of MTV, the mall as a social hub, and consumerism-as-identity. the validity of this so-called &ldquo;nostalgia&rdquo; is up for debate, but their definitely a familiarity to it. However, like suggested in most guides on mallsoft, or vaporwave in general,</p>
