<p>I had to go to the ear doctor today. I have fucked up ears, so I am a regular at my ENT clinic. The clinic is way off the beaten path, and I always have to walk through the parking lot of the Clackamas Town Center, between the lightrail and the clinic. It has become a normal thing for me to go to Barnes &amp; Noble their to pick up the latest copy of the Atlantic with hopes of impressing the pretty girls answering the phones at the doctors office. Today, my appointment was earlier than usual, so I figured I would walk a lap of the mall and see what the &ldquo;mall world&rdquo; is like.</p>
<p>Now, as of the last few years, I have become mildly obsessed with the concept of the mall. Whether it is the Mallsoft subgenre of vaporwave I have been listening to or watching abandoned mall videos, the mall has been a regular thought of mine for a while. Mallsoft is a genre of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxayjNCSBzs">vaporwave</a> and/or <a href="http://www.plunderphonics.com/xhtml/xplunder.html">plunderphonics</a> where Muzak, soft jazz, or easy listening tracks are sampled, compressed, distorted, and layered with ambient crowd/mall sounds to create an ephemeral and somehow nostalgic &ldquo;mall-like experience.&rdquo; As someone who grew up in the 80s, during the advent of MTV, the mall as a social hub, and consumerism-as-identity; the validity of this so-called &ldquo;nostalgia&rdquo; is up for debate, but there is definitely a familiarity to it. However, this familiarity is hautingly dystopic. Due to the slowed down easy-listening track, complete with reverb to sound as if the music is echoing through a cavernous mall, coupled with a persistant disembodied murmur of voices with none directed at the listener, one can&rsquo;t help but feel lost and/or lonely. All that being said, I love it.</p>
<p>And then there is one of my favorite YouTube channels (still trying to figure out how to kick my YouTube habit), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjU-Cwjfqbo2hMRItlXwnnQ">This is Dan Bell</a> and his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNz4Un92pGNxQ9vNgmnCx7dwchPJGJ3IQ">Dead Mall Series</a>. One of my favorites is his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIx_YM5ER5Q">tour of the Sunrise Mall</a> from <em>The Legend of Billie Jean</em>, one of my all-time favorite movies. Having grown up going to the mall to hang out, as well as <em>Mallrats</em> being another of my all-time favorite movies, these videos fill me with a joyful nostalgia, a sense of era-ending dread, and gleeful anti-capitalism all at once.</p>
<p>And then in complete contrast to the death of our in-person, mall wandering, consumerism, I am face to face with a bustling mall, full of people finding identity on the shelves of their favorite shops. Kids are wearing JNCOs again. I saw a girl in bondage pants, bright purple knee-high Gene Simmons-esque platform boots, a Nirvana hoodie with every type of accessory and acoutrement imaginable. I secretly admired her and cringed simultaneously. As I dined on my over-caloric lunch, watching the families shopping and eating, I reminisced of a long gone day when I used to dream of working in the mall, maybe at Tower Records, B. Dalton Booksellers, or CompUSA. I remembered learning to smoke in the service entrance of the mall movie theater. The first girl I kissed outside the Wunderland nickle arcade.</p>
<p>Part of me was grateful for the stroll down memory lane. Part of me still wonders what exactly it is that the Clackamas Town Center is doing right, when so many malls across the country somehow got it wrong. And then a deeper, more shameful depth of me, just wished we could let the mall die the heroes death it so rightfully deserves. It carried us through Reagan-nomics, the first Gulf War, Bill Clinton&rsquo;s blowjob, and 9-11. So many things in my life are punctuated by specific trips to the mall. So much, and yet still so little, has happened since. I guess maybe I just fear the constant reminder of my youth, the direction my life went, where it could have gone, and the hidden regrets I always claim I don&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>So I will go back to living in a world where the malls of my childhood are dead. Yet even as I type this, some kid has snuck out of his house and is meeting his friends in the mall parking lot, where they are smoking pot and doing cookies, waiting for the tomorrow that never seems to come. And if it does, they just go inside, get a corn dog, and laugh with their friends at the levity of it all.</p>
