			<p>I have a Youtube addiction. My default is spending hours a day, consuming Linux, LOSS (I have decided to start using &ldquo;Libre&rdquo; in place of &ldquo;Free&rdquo; in Free &amp; Open Source Software just to piss off all the RMS/Free Software folks), gaming, and tech content. I spend more time watching stuff about the things I want to do, than I spend time actually doing the things I want to do. It&rsquo;s actually kind of pathetic, and the shame is really starting to get to me. However, I find myself getting sucked into culture war bullshit. And then I am up till 4am in a death spiral of consuming content that I find vile, blindly ideological, partisan, and proof of diminishing intellectual fortitude&mdash;<em>on both &ldquo;sides.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>I thought I might be able to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; this by switching to Odysee. My initial descent into Odysee was less than pleasant. Apparently, Odysee is where all the cancelled far-right leaning voices go to die. Findind progressive/anarchist content on the platform is like pulling teeth. But I decided to give it another try, as I loathe Google, and a lot of my favorite Linux content creators have their content posted there. I figured I could engage solely with the content of my choice, outside of the Google algorithim and long extensive trackers. And I was content on moving my content consuming addiction to the new platform.</p>
<p>But then I got a notification for some Odysee &ldquo;Better Discourses Conference.&rdquo; Interested in the concept, I clicked the notification. They claim to have voices from &ldquo;various sides of the political spectrum.&rdquo; When I looked at the list, I could only shake my head. Out of the 20 to 30 some presenters, I found <strong>two</strong> maybe two and half left-leaning or nuanced voices.</p>
